        BigDog is a famous quadruped robot developed by Boston Dynamics. Designed for rough-terrain locomotion, 
        it features advanced sensors, dynamic control, and powerful hydraulics to move across challenging surfaces. 
        Our products can help achieve similar robust actuation and force control for legged robotic applications.

      </div>
      <p>
        A hydraulic hexapod system offers powerful and precise control for multi-legged robots. 
        With six independently actuated legs, it can traverse complex terrains or serve as a high-precision 
        motion platform. Our solutions provide the compact and efficient hydraulic power needed to drive each leg 
        with accuracy.

        <img src="images/flight_simulator.jpg" alt="Flight Simulator">
      </div>
      <p>
        Flight simulators rely on smooth and realistic motion cues to replicate the sensation of flight. 
        High-performance actuation systems are essential to mimic roll, pitch, and yaw accurately. 
        Our hydraulic solutions can power these motion platforms with minimal latency and maximum fidelity.

      </div>
      <p>
        Modern prosthetic limbs require a balance of strength, lightness, and precise control. 
        Hydraulic actuation enables a smooth and powerful movement while maintaining a compact form factor. 
        Our products can help researchers and manufacturers build advanced prosthetic solutions that enhance 
        mobility for users.
